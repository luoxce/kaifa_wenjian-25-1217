    "commentary": "Technical analysis shows conflicting signals: strong uptrend (ADX 37.95, price above EMAs) but bearish MACD and KDJ cross. Market snapshot shows BTC at $87,849 with RSI 59.76 (neutral). Account has existing BTC long position with 7.4% unrealized PnL. Balanced profile suggests waiting for clearer setup. No strong catalyst or edge to justify new position. Respect risk discipline and portfolio concentration rules."
